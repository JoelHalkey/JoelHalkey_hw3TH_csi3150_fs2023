**Disclaimer**

I wasn't able to complete any of the drop downs or read more's, although they aren't necessarily the worst to implement, they take time to get functional and presentable.

All images of the landscapes and people were taken from unsplash.com, using the free license images only.

I just tried my best to be able to replicate the layouts of the pages as best as I could.
